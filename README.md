Small little toy [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) to play around with Common Lisp some more:

- Explore [CLOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System) and generic functions
- Explore use of LLMs to generate many descriptive phrases of the
  same "terrain" in advance

# Building

Prerequisites:

- [SBCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Bank_Common_Lisp)
- `make`

To build the project, simply run `make` in the root directory. This will compile the project and create an executable called `rectumon`.

To install in $BINDIR, run `make install`.
